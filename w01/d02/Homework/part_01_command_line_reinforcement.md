## Part 1: Command Line Reinforcement HW

Professional developers use their consoles all day and rarely rely on their mice, therefore it's vital that you build upon your understanding of the command line and using keyboard shortcuts. 

#### Learning Objectives

* discover keyboard shortcuts that will speed your in-class workflow
* build upon your understanding of Git remotes
* reinforce your understanding of the command line
* expand your understanding of Markdown

#### Directions

1. First and foremost, __don't use your mouse.__ If you feel like you need your mouse, Google whatever it is you're trying to accomplish and see if there is a keyboard shortcut for the task. 
1. Create a file, `w01_d02_code_snippets.md`, within your `~/Desktop/markdown_assignments` directory
1. Open this file from the command line and break down 10 of the command lines commands you learned today, paying particular attention to those related to remote Git repositories.
1. Include at least two images in your markdown file. These images should be screengrabs (which you can create via `command + shift + 4` and dragging your mouse over the target area) that display a piece of the terminal window containing a code snippet you've struggled with and the associated output.
1. Make commits as you progress, and after each commit, push your code up to your public `markdown_assignments` repo on GitHub.
